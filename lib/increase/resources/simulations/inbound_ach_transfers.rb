        # Simulates an inbound ACH transfer to your account. This imitates initiating a
        #   transfer to an Increase account from a different financial institution. The
        #   transfer may be either a credit or a debit depending on if the `amount` is
        #   positive or negative. The result of calling this API will contain the created
        #   transfer. You can pass a `resolve_at` parameter to allow for a window to
        #   [action on the Inbound ACH Transfer](https://increase.com/documentation/receiving-ach-transfers).
        #   Alternatively, if you don't pass the `resolve_at` parameter the result will
        #   contain either a [Transaction](#transactions) or a
        #   [Declined Transaction](#declined-transactions) depending on whether or not the
        #   transfer is allowed.
