      class CardAuthorizations
        # Simulates a purchase authorization on a [Card](#cards). Depending on the balance
        #   available to the card and the `amount` submitted, the authorization activity
        #   will result in a [Pending Transaction](#pending-transactions) of type
        #   `card_authorization` or a [Declined Transaction](#declined-transactions) of type
        #   `card_decline`. You can pass either a Card id or a
        #   [Digital Wallet Token](#digital-wallet-tokens) id to simulate the two different
        #   ways purchases can be made.
        #
        # @param params [Increase::Models::Simulations::CardAuthorizationCreateParams, Hash{Symbol=>Object}] .
        #

        #
        #   @option params [String] :authenticated_card_payment_id The identifier of a Card Payment with a `card_authentication` if you want to

        #
        #   @option params [Symbol, Increase::Models::Simulations::CardAuthorizationCreateParams::DeclineReason] :decline_reason Forces a card decline with a specific reason. No real time decision will be
        #     sent.
        #
        #   @option params [String] :digital_wallet_token_id The identifier of the Digital Wallet Token to be authorized.

        #
        #   @option params [String] :event_subscription_id The identifier of the Event Subscription to use. If provided, will override the
        #     default real time event subscription. Because you can only create one real time
        #     decision event subscription, you can use this field to route events to any
        #     specified event subscription for testing purposes.
        #
        #   @option params [String] :merchant_acceptor_id The merchant identifier (commonly abbreviated as MID) of the merchant the card
