        # Simulates a purchase authorization on a [Card](#cards). Depending on the balance
        #   available to the card and the `amount` submitted, the authorization activity
        #   will result in a [Pending Transaction](#pending-transactions) of type
        #   `card_authorization` or a [Declined Transaction](#declined-transactions) of type
        #   `card_decline`. You can pass either a Card id or a
        #   [Digital Wallet Token](#digital-wallet-tokens) id to simulate the two different
        #   ways purchases can be made.
        #
        # @param params [Hash] Attributes to send in this request.
        # @option params [Integer] :amount The authorization amount in cents.
        # @option params [String, nil] :card_id The identifier of the Card to be authorized.
        # @option params [Symbol, DeclineReason, nil] :decline_reason Forces a card decline with a specific reason. No real time decision will be
        #   sent.
        # @option params [String, nil] :digital_wallet_token_id The identifier of the Digital Wallet Token to be authorized.
        # @option params [Symbol, Direction, nil] :direction The direction describes the direction the funds will move, either from the
        #   cardholder to the merchant or from the merchant to the cardholder.
        # @option params [String, nil] :event_subscription_id The identifier of the Event Subscription to use. If provided, will override the
        #   default real time event subscription. Because you can only create one real time
        #   decision event subscription, you can use this field to route events to any
        #   specified event subscription for testing purposes.
        # @option params [String, nil] :merchant_acceptor_id The merchant identifier (commonly abbreviated as MID) of the merchant the card
        #   is transacting with.
        # @option params [String, nil] :merchant_category_code The Merchant Category Code (commonly abbreviated as MCC) of the merchant the
        #   card is transacting with.
        # @option params [String, nil] :merchant_city The city the merchant resides in.
        # @option params [String, nil] :merchant_country The country the merchant resides in.
        # @option params [String, nil] :merchant_descriptor The merchant descriptor of the merchant the card is transacting with.
        # @option params [String, nil] :physical_card_id The identifier of the Physical Card to be authorized.
        #
        # @param opts [Hash, Increase::RequestOptions] Options to specify HTTP behaviour for this request.
